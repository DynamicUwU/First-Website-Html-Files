<h2>MY FAMILY</h2>

<p>
My family is ordinary, like your typical Filipino family. I have my parents and a little brother that’s 3 years younger than me.<br/>
We usually get along well and if there are any quarrels it often gets fixed pretty quickly.<br/>
I don’t know what else to say really, I love them, and they feel the same towards me. 
</p>
<p>
There is also my relatives, I do get along with most of them well but mostly on my mother’s side as I barely get to socialize with anyone on my father’s side.<br/>
 Again, standard family stuff.
</p>
<p>
And in case anyone’s wondering, I don’t have any grudges nor problems with any of my relatives or my family that I live with as of writing this.<br/>
 And I hope I don’t get into any in the future.
