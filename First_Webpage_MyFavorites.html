<ul type="disc"> </ul>
<li> Anime</li> 
	<ul type="circle">
	<li> I started to get into this only recently, but I have been getting into things related to it for a long time now, </br>
	     the thing that attracted me the most is the art. I don’t know why but there’s just something about it that attracts me. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc"> </ul>
<li> Games</li>
	<ul type="circle">
	<li> I have been into this for a long time and is one of the main reasons I got into anime, as I have been playing games with its art style.</br>
	     But that aside, playing games just feels good. Or at least depending on the game you are playing. As some games are designed to make you feel angry. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc"> </ul>
<li> Extras (Ones that require less meaning as the document would be longer otherwise)</li>
	<ul type="circle">
	<li> Watching YouTube content creators (Ones that stream with an anime avatar or "vtubers", regular streamers, documentaries, history channels, bands)</li>
	<li> Hanging out with friends</li>
	<li> Eating</li>
</ul>
<p> And those are the only ones at the top of my head, Pretty sure I didn’t mention all of it.</p>
