<h2 style="color:white">MY FRIENDS</h2>
<p style="color:magenta;font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">
Honestly, I don’t know what else to write about them. I think they’re great, we usually have each other’s backs during serious problems,<br/>
and we also do hang out often, online, or personal.
</p>
<p style="color:magenta;font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">  
As with almost everyone who has a friend group, I am closer to some of my friends as compared to my other friends though,<br/>
 so I do spend more time with certain people as compared to the others.
</p>
<p style="color:magenta;font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">
One of the things I appreciate about them the most is that they pretty much got me into some things that ended up becoming my “safe space” or the thing (hobbies or likes)<br/>
that I use to make myself comfortable when under pressure from anything or anyone.
